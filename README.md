# credit-card-fraud-detection
Credit card fraud is a serious issue in the financial sector, with millions lost each year to fraudulent transactions. This project aims to build a machine learning-based model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world data. The primary challenge addressed is the extreme class imbalance, where fraud cases represent a very small fraction of all transactions.

Using the Random Forest Classifier, the project focuses on:

Preprocessing the dataset effectively

Handling imbalanced classes

Evaluating the model with metrics that matter in fraud detection (precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC)

The results show that the model performs with high accuracy and strong recall, making it suitable for deployment in real-world fraud monitoring systems.
